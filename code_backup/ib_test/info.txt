Limitations:
No more than 50 outstanding requests at a time. They note that it is probably more efficient to do fewer requests rather than try to test the upper limit.

If asking for 30 second bars or lower, no 6 requests for the same contract in 2 seconds, 60 requests in 10 minutes, or two identical in 15 seconds. 
If you are grabbing consecutive single days for a symbol you can hit this limit pretty easily.

In general, if your request will return more than a few thousand bars you should consider splitting it up.
